# genpw.py

A password generator based on the Python 3.0 `secrets` module, and an
extension of the examples provided in its
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html).

Pass a length on the command line. If no length or an invalid length is
passed, a default length of 16 is used.

Passwords will contain an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, and a
digit.
